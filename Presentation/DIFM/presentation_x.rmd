# Site-specific Economically Optimal Input Rates

+ On-farm Precision Experimentation (OFPE)
  - more spatially granular data of yield, inputs of interest (e.g., fertilizer, seed)
  - other field/soil characteristics
+ Steps:
  1. Run input experiments
  2. Collect data
  3. <span style = "color: red;"> Estimate yield response function based on the data </span>  
  4. Estimate the economically optimal site-specific input rates

# Yield Response and EOIR Estimation

+ Application of various machine learning methods
  - Random Forest `r Citep(bib, c("krause2020random", "MARQUESRAMOS2020105791"))`
  - Convolutional Neural Network `r Citep(bib, "barbosa2020modeling")`
+ Many studies
  + stop at predicting yields without identifying EOIR
  + use information that is not available to farmers at the time of their management decision making

# Yield and EOIR prediction

Consider this stylized conceptual model:

$$Yield = f(I, c, x) + g(c, x)$$

+ <span style = "color: red;"> $f(I, c, x)$ </span>: $0.4$ at maximum
+ $g(c, x)$: $0.6$ at maximum

```{r }
data.table(
  model = rep(c("model 1", "model 2", "model 3"), each = 2),
  component = rep(c("f", "g"), 3),
  explained = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.3, 0.6, 0.4, 0.4),
  `R-squared` = c(0.8, 0.8, 0.9, 0.9, 0.8, 0.8)
) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  color(i = c(3, 4), j = 1, color = "blue") %>%
  color(i = c(5, 6), j = 1, color = "red") %>%
  merge_v(j = c(1, 4)) %>%
  hline(i = c(2, 4, 6)) %>%
  fix_border_issues() %>%
  align(j = c(2, 3, 4), align = "center") %>%
  autofit()

# Predicting Yield <span style = "color: red;"> Level </span> is Sufficient, but not Necessary

+ Consider a very simple profit maximization problem

$$\max_{I} \quad pf(I, \mathbf{c}) - wI$$

+ $p$: crop price
+ $f(\cdot)$: yield function
+ $I$: input
+ $c$: collection of other variables
+ $w$: input price

--

.content-box-red[**First order condition**]:

$$\frac{\partial f(I^{*}(p,w,\mathbf{c}), \mathbf{c})}{\partial I} \equiv \frac{w}{p}$$

What you need is the impact of input on yield (difference in yield moving from one rate to another)

# Causal Forest and other traditional ML methods

+ Traditional ML methods (e.g., Random Forest, Boosted Regression Forest, CNN) 
  - is designed to estimate the <span style = "color: red;"> level </span> of the dependent variable (yield) well
  - once the yield model is trained, you can estimate the impact of a treatment (just plug in two different rates and see the difference in their predicted yield values) 

+ Causal Forest (a causal machine learning method)
  - is designed to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects directly without predicting yield levels

# Research Question

+ Does Causal Forest (CF) outperform traditional ML approaches in estimating site-specific EOIR and result in higher economic profits?

+ Can you trust yield prediction accuracy as the criteria to select a model when your ultimate goal is to find the model that produces the highest economic profit?

---
class: middle

# Method

+ Monte Carlo simulation
  - hypothetical field, on which OFPEs are run
  - site-specific yield response functions are known (to researchers)
  - site-specific economically optimal input rates are known for a given combination of crop and input prices

<span style = "color: red;"> Important Note </span>: Using real-world data, you are never ever able to test which model performs the best in terms of the economic performance of site-specific input recommendations because you do not observe true yield response functions

# Yield Response Functions

Yield response function is assumed to follow Mitscherlich-Baule functional form:

$$f(N, \mathbf{c}) = ymax(\mathbf{c})(1-exp(\alpha(\mathbf{c}) + \beta(\mathbf{c}) N)) + \varepsilon$$

+ $c$: a collection of site-specific characteristics
+ $\varepsilon$: error 

--

Researchers observe and use yield, N, and $c$ to train models.

# Modeling Scenarios

Researchers observe all the variables (characteristics) that govern site-specific yield response functions, but do not know the functional form.

+ **abytt**: $\alpha$, $\beta$, ymax, $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$ $(\theta$s are irrelevant variables)

  - $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$ $(\beta = \beta_1 + \beta_2)$

# Conclusions

## Economic Performance
+ Random Forest should not be used. It is simply worse than BRF and CF and vulnerable to irrelevant variables.
+ CF outperforms RF, BRF, CNN
+ **Caveats**:
  * CNN used a particular architecture suggested by `r Citep(bib, "barbosa2020modeling")`, and other architectures may perform better
  * If the experimental settings differ (yield response functions, trial design, etx), the results can of course be different (I already found a case where BRF performs better than CF just yesterday)

--

## Yield Prediction vs EONR Prediction
+ Yield prediction accuracy has very little to do with EONR prediction accuracy
+ Picking a model based on yield prediction accuracy does not necessarily lead you to a model that is good at predicting EONR

# Extensions

+ Collaborate across the teams to see which model works the best under what condition?
+ Can we identify factors that lets us know what approach to use with some confidence?
