# Highlights:

+ Causal Forest is a novel machine learning method focusing on the identification of heterogeneous causal effects of treatment unlike the conventional machine learning methods.

+ Causal Forest outperforms Random Forest, Boosted Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Network in estimating site-specific EONR.

+ The model's yield prediction accuracy provides little if any information about its EONR prediction accuracy.
