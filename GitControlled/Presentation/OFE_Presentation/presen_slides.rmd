# Background
+ The application of Machine Learning(ML) methods for site-specific economically optimal input rates (EOIR) (e.g., seed, fertilizer) have been getting more attention in recent years
\newline
  + @barbosa2020modeling applied Convolutional Neural Network
  + @krause2020random used Random Forest-based approaches
  + @Gardner21, @Wang2021, @coulibali2020, etc.

# Research Gap

+ The conventional ML methods focus on predicting yield well rather than causal identification of input on yield
+ The past studies have used predictive ability of yield for validity of their models.
\newline

## note
+ EOIR estimation should be based on the change in yields associated with the change in input levels *ceteris paribus*
+ Having good yield prediction capability does not necessarily mean it is also capable of estimating EOIR well
<!-- + Because causal identification between yield and input is necessary for estimation of EONR, and such causal inference and having good prediction is different two distinct object -->

---

# New Trend of Causal Machine Learning Application 
+ Causal Machine Learning (CML) methods:
  + Unlike the conventional prediction-oriented ML methods, CML focuses on identifying causal impacts of an event (in our context, an increase or decrease in input rate for example)
  \newline
+ **Causal Forest (CF) ** [@Wager2018a; @athey2016recursive]:
  + CF estimates heterogeneous causal impacts of a treatment (a change in the input level) based on observed characteristics (e.g., organic matter)
<!-- + Hence, CF seems particularly suitable for estimating site-specific yield response functions and then EOIR.  -->

---

# Research Questions

##
+ In terms of estimating EOIR, how do CF-based methods (CF-stepwise and CF-base) compare to other prediction-oriented ML methods: Random Forest (RF), Boosted Random Forest (BRF), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?
\newline
+ Is the predictive ability of yield a good indicator of the performance of EOIR estimation?

---

# Methods
+ Conduct one thousand rounds of Monte Carlo simulations under four different production scenarios
+ Compare the performance in estimating economically optimal nitrogen rates (EONR) of CF-based methods (CF-base and CF-stepwise) to other methods: RF, BRF, and CNN
+ For RF, BRF, and CNN, contrast their EONR performances against their yield prediction performances
<!-- +  Evaluation metric: R-squared of estimated EONR and R-squared of predicted yield -->

# Key Results: EONR estimation

```{r res-N, out.width = "70%"}
# knit_print(table_optN_subplot_wide)
knitr::include_graphics("table_optN.png")
```

# Key Results: EONR estimation and Yield Prediction

```{r res-yield, out.width = "70%"}
# knit_print(table_optN_subplot_wide)
knitr::include_graphics("table_y.png")
```
---

# Key Findings
## 
+ The proposed CF-base method is capable of estimating site-specific EONR more accurately than other prediction-oriented ML methods 
\newline
+ The ability of predicting yield does not necessarily translate to good performance in estimating EONR.
